"#Why condense the Scrum Guide?#" - a brief #explanation#
	
	The #2020 Scrum Guide# on one page for #laptop# or #mobile#,~with #full drill down# back to the #original text#.
	
	#Scrum# is a #popular approach#, which is #widely used#.~It is an #incomplete framework#; to #use# it is to #customise# it.
	But the core of #Scrum# has a #precise definition#, with~#principles#, #values#, #accountabilities#, #events#, and #artifacts#.
	
	This page #presents# and #explains# Scrum #clearly# and #easily#.
	We hope that #when scrums are created# (or #as necessary#),~everyone can #walk through# the Scrum Guide #together#.
	
	This is for #customers to know# what they are #buying#,~and for #teams to know# what they are #selling#.
	
	It is to help #teams# to #self-manage#, through #discussions#~based on #common understanding# and #evidence#.
	
	Lastly, it is to help #teams# and #customers# to #agree about#~the #right ways of working# towards a #shared product vision#.
	
	We hope that #you# will enjoy reading it.

"#How does this page work?#" - a short #how-to# manual
	
	Plain text is #summarised information# from the 2023 Scrum Guide, which you can click to drill down #on#
		Yes, just like that
	
	"• Grey boxes are #the full original text# from the 2023 Scrum Guide, which is the thing that you drill down #to#
	

"#Purpose of the Scrum Guide#" - to be the #single document#~that #defines# the #core scrum framework#
	
	#Scrum# began in the 1990s, and the #Scrum Guide# has been #continuously evolving# since #2010#
		"We developed Scrum in the early 1990s. We wrote the first version of the Scrum Guide in 2010 to help people worldwide understand Scrum. We have evolved the Guide since then through small, functional updates. Together, we stand behind it.
	The Scrum Guide #defines# the #core ideas of Scrum#, which are #all# considered #essential# and #unchangeable#
		"The Scrum Guide contains the definition of Scrum. Each element of the framework serves a specific purpose that is essential to the overall value and results realized with Scrum. Changing the core design or ideas of Scrum, leaving out elements, or not following the rules of Scrum, covers up problems and limits the benefits of Scrum, potentially even rendering it useless.
	Scrum is #popular# and has spread across #many domains# ...
		"We follow the growing use of Scrum within an ever-growing complex world. We are humbled to see Scrum being adopted in many domains holding essentially complex work, beyond software product development where Scrum has its roots. As Scrum’s use spreads, developers, researchers, analysts, scientists, and other specialists do the work. We use the word “developers” in Scrum not to exclude, but to simplify. If you get value from Scrum, consider yourself included.
	...&nbsp;and Scrum can be #extended# in lots of #useful ways#
		"As Scrum is being used, patterns, processes, and insights that fit the Scrum framework as described in this document, may be found, applied and devised.
	However, the #Scrum Guide# only contains the #core Scrum framework#, and no more
		"Their description is beyond the purpose of the Scrum Guide because they are context sensitive and differ widely between Scrum uses. Such tactics for using within the Scrum framework vary widely and are described elsewhere.

"#Scrum Definition#" - a #simple# and #iterative# approach~to #creating value# by solving #complex problems#
	
	"• Scrum is a #lightweight framework# that helps #people#, #teams# and #organizations# generate #value# through #adaptive solutions# for #complex problems#
	• In a nutshell, Scrum requires a #Scrum Master# to foster an #environment# where
	        1) A #Product Owner# orders the work for a #complex problem# into a #Product Backlog#
	        2) The #Developers# turn a #selection# of the work into an #Increment# of #value# during a #Sprint#
	        3) The #entire Team# and its #stakeholders# can then #inspect# the results to #adjust# for the #next Sprint#
	        4) #Repeat#
	Scrum has been #designed# as a #simple and incomplete# method for helping #intelligent people# to #achieve goals# and #create value#
		"Scrum is simple. Try it as is and determine if its philosophy, theory, and structure help to achieve goals and create value. The Scrum framework is purposefully incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it. Rather than provide people with detailed instructions, the rules of Scrum guide their relationships and interactions.
	Scrum can contain #other project methodologies# and/or #existing practices#, to #make them visible#, #improve them# and/or #render them unnecessary#
		"Various processes, techniques and methods can be employed within the framework. Scrum wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work techniques, so that improvements can be made.
	
"#Scrum Theory#" - #efficient# and #focused# teamwork,~through #transparency#, #observation# and #adaptation#
	
	"Scrum is founded on #Empiricism# and #Lean Thinking#
		"• #Empiricism# asserts that #knowledge# comes from #experience# and making #decisions# based on what is #observed# 
		• #Lean thinking# reduces waste and #focuses on the essentials#
		• Scrum employs an #Iterative#, #Incremental# approach to optimize #Predictability# and to #Control Risk#
		• Scrum engages #groups of people# who #collectively# have all the #skills and expertise# to #do the work# and #share or acquire# such skills as needed
	The #Main Scrum Event#, or #Sprint#, contains the #Four Scrum Events# - #Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, #and# Sprint Retrospective#
		"Scrum combines four formal events for inspection and adaptation within a containing event, the Sprint.
	"• These events work because they implement the #empirical Scrum pillars# of #Transparency#, #Inspection#, and #Adaptation#
	
	#What is Transparency?#
		The #emergent process and work# must be #visible# to the #Team# and to the #Customers#
			"The emergent process and work must be visible to those performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
		#Important decisions# are based on the three #Artifacts# - #Product Goal#, #Sprint Goal#, and #Definition of Done#
			"With Scrum, important decisions are based on the perceived state of its three formal artifacts.
		#Transparent Artifacts# allow the team to #make decisions# that #increase value# and #reduce risk#
			"Artifacts that have low transparency can lead to decisions that diminish value and increase risk.
		"• #Transparency# enables #Inspection# - Inspection without Transparency is #misleading and wasteful#
	#What is Inspection?#
		"• The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems
		• To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five #events#
		• #Inspection# enables #Adaptation# - Inspection without Adaptation is considered #pointless#
		• Scrum events are designed to provoke #change#
	#What is Adaptation?#
		• Aspects of a #process# can go outside #acceptable limits#, or the resulting #product# can be #unacceptable#
		If so, then the process or the product must be #adjusted as soon as possible# to avoid #further deviation#
			"If any aspects of a process deviate outside acceptable limits or if the resulting product is unacceptable, the process being applied or the materials being produced must be adjusted. The adjustment must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.
		#Empowerment# and #self-management# help the Team to #rapidly adapt# as they #learn# by #inspection#
			"Adaptation becomes more difficult when the people involved are not empowered or self-managing. A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.
	
"#Scrum Values#" - scrum teams aspire to~#commitment#, #focus#, #openness#, #respect#, and #courage#
	
	"#Successful use of Scrum# depends on #people# becoming #proficient# in living five #Scrum Values#
	• #Commitment# - Team #commits# to achieving its #goals# and to #supporting# each other
	• #Focus# – Their primary #focus# is on the #work# of the Sprint to make the #best progress# toward the #goals#
	• #Openness# - The Scrum Team and its #stakeholders# are #open# about the #work# and the #challenges#
	• #Respect# - Scrum Team members #respect# each other to be #capable, independent people#, and are #respected as such# by the people with whom they work
	• #Courage# - The Scrum Team members have the courage to do the #right thing#, to work on #tough problems#
	
	"These values give #direction# to the Scrum Team with regard to their #work#, #actions#, and #behavior#
		"The #decisions that are made#, the #steps taken#, and the #way Scrum is used# should #reinforce these values#, not diminish or undermine them.
		The Scrum Team members #learn and explore the values# as they work with the Scrum #events and artifacts#.
		When these values are #embodied by the Scrum Team# and the people they work with, the #empirical Scrum pillars# of #transparency#, #inspection#, and #adaptation# come to life #building trust#.

"#Scrum Team#" - a #scrum master#, a #product owner# and some #developers#, working in #sprints# towards a #single product goal#
	
	Scrum teams should be #small# and #self-managing#, with #shared skills# and #collective responsibility#
		"The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum Team. The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.
		"Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide who does what, when, and how.
		"The Scrum Team is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint, typically 10 or fewer people. In general, we have found that smaller teams communicate better and are more productive. If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, each focused on the same product. Therefore, they should share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.
		"The Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related activities from stakeholder collaboration, verification, maintenance, operation, experimentation, research and development, and anything else that might be required. They are structured and empowered by the organization to manage their own work. Working in Sprints at a sustainable pace improves the Scrum Team’s focus and consistency.
	"• The #entire Scrum Team# is #accountable# for creating a #valuable, useful Increment# every #Sprint#
	"• Scrum defines three #specific accountabilities# within the Scrum Team: the #Developers#, the #Product Owner#, and the #Scrum Master#
	
	The #Developers# are #accountable# for the #delivery plan# (the #Sprint Backlog#) and #quality standards# (the #Definition of Done#) to achieve the #Sprint Goal#
		"#Developers# are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint.
		The specific skills needed by the Developers are often broad and will vary with the domain of work. However, the Developers are always accountable for
		• Creating a #plan# for the Sprint, the #Sprint Backlog#
		• Instilling #quality# by adhering to a #Definition of Done#
		• #Adapting# their plan each day toward the #Sprint Goal#
		• Holding each other #accountable# as professionals
	The #Product Owner# is #accountable# for #defining and communicating# the #Product Backlog# and #Product Goal#, and for #maximising product value#
		"The Product Owner is #accountable# for #maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work# of the Scrum Team.
		How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.
		"The Product Owner is also #accountable# for #effective Product Backlog management#, which includes:
		• Developing and explicitly communicating the #Product Goal#
		• Creating and clearly communicating #Product Backlog# items
		• #Ordering# Product Backlog items
		• Ensuring that the Product Backlog is #transparent#, #visible,# and #understood#
		"The #Product Owner# may do the above work or may #delegate the responsibility# to others.
		Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.
		"For #Product Owners# to #succeed#, the entire organization must #respect# their #decisions, #which# #are visible
		• In the #content# and #ordering# of the #Product Backlog#
		• Through the #inspectable Increment# at the #Sprint Review#
		"The Product Owner is #one person#, not a committee.
		The Product Owner may #represent# the needs of #many stakeholders# in the #Product Backlog#.
		Those wanting to change the Product Backlog can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.
	The #Scrum Master# is #accountable# for #establishing# the #correct# and #effective# practice of #Scrum#
		The #Scrum Master# is #accountable# for
		Establishing the Scrum Guide, so the Team and organization #understand# Scrum #theory# and #practice# 
			"The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.
		Owning the Team’s #effectiveness# by enabling it to #improve# its #practices# within the Scrum framework
			"The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness.
			They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.
			"Scrum Masters are true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization.
		The #Scrum Master serves the Team#
			"The Scrum Master serves the Team in several ways, including
			• #Coaching# the team members in #self-management# and #cross-functionality#
			• Helping the Team #focus# on creating high-value #Increments# that meet the #Definition of Done#
			• Causing the #removal of impediments# to the Team’s progress
			• Ensuring that Scrum events take place and are #positive#, #productive#, and kept within #timebox#
		The #Scrum Master serves the Product Owner#
			"The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including
			• Help find techniques for effective #Product Goal definition# and #Product Backlog management#
			• Help the Team understand the need for #clear# and #concise# Product Backlog items
			• Help establish #empirical product planning# for a complex environment
			• Facilitate #stakeholder collaboration# as requested or needed
		The #Scrum Master serves the organization#
			"The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including
			• #Leading#, #training#, and #coaching# the organization in its #Scrum adoption#
			• #Planning# and #advising# Scrum implementations within the organization
			• Helping employees and stakeholders #understand# and #enact# an #empirical approach# for complex work
			• #Removing barriers# between stakeholders and Teams
	
"#Scrum Events#" - a recurring #sprint#, containing #sprint planning#, #daily scrum#, #sprint review# and #sprint retrospective#
	
	#Overview#
		"The Sprint is a container for all other events
		"Each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt Scrum artifacts. These events are specifically designed to enable the transparency required.
		"Failure to operate any events as prescribed results in lost opportunities to inspect and adapt. Events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
		"Optimally, all events are held at the same time and place to reduce complexity.
	The #Sprint# - this #contains# all of the #work#, including the #Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective# events
		"Sprints are the heartbeat of Scrum, where ideas are turned into value.
			"They are fixed length events of one month or less to create consistency.
			A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.
			All the work necessary to achieve the Product Goal, including Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective, happen within Sprints.
		"During the Sprint
		• #No changes# are made that would endanger the #Sprint Goal#
		• #Quality# does not decrease
		• The #Product Backlog# is #refined# as needed
		• #Scope# may be #clarified# and #renegotiated# with the Product Owner as more is learned
		"Sprints enable #predictability#, through #inspection# and #adaptation# of #progress# towards a Product Goal at least every calendar month.
			"When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the Sprint Goal may become invalid, complexity may rise, and risk may increase.
			Shorter Sprints can be employed to generate more learning cycles and limit risk of cost and effort to a smaller time frame.
			Each Sprint may be considered a short project.
		"• Various #practices# exist to forecast progress, like #burn-downs#, #burn-ups#, or #cumulative flows#.
		These #practices# help but do not replace #empiricism#, because in complex environments, the #future# is #unknown#
			"While proven useful, these do not replace the importance of empiricism.
			In complex environments, what will happen is unknown.
		"• Only what has #already happened# may be used for forward-looking #decision# making.
		The #Product Owner# may #cancel# a Sprint if the Sprint Goal becomes #obsolete#
			"A Sprint could be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint.
	
	#Sprint Planning# - the Sprint #starts# with the team #selecting# and #planning# work for it - this involves the #whole team#, plus any #advisors#
		"Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint.
			"This resulting plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.
			The Product Owner ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items and how they map to the Product Goal.
			The Scrum Team may also invite other people to attend Sprint Planning to provide advice.
		"Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:
		"Topic One:# Why is this Sprint valuable?#
			"The Product Owner proposes how the product could increase its value and utility in the current Sprint. The whole Scrum Team then collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that communicates why the Sprint is valuable to stakeholders. The Sprint Goal must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.
		"Topic Two:# What can be Done this Sprint?#
			"Through discussion with the Product Owner, the Developers select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint. The Scrum Team may refine these items during this process, which increases understanding and confidence.
			"Selecting how much can be completed within a Sprint may be challenging. However, the more the Developers know about their past performance, their upcoming capacity, and their Definition of Done, the more confident they will be in their Sprint forecasts.
		"Topic Three:# How will the chosen work get done?#
			"For each selected Product Backlog item, the Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done. This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the Developers. No one else tells them how to turn Product Backlog items into Increments of value.
		"The #Sprint Goal#, the #Product Backlog# items selected for the Sprint, plus the #plan for delivering them# are together referred to as the #Sprint Backlog#.
		"Sprint Planning is timeboxed to a #maximum of eight hours# for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
	#Daily Scrum# - #each working day#, the Team inspects #progress# toward the Sprint Goal and can adapt the #Sprint Backlog# to that end
		#15-minute daily event# at a #fixed time#, for the #Developers# to #focus# on the #Sprint Goal# and produce a  #plan# for the day
			"The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
			"The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the Product Owner or Scrum Master are actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog, they participate as Developers.
			"The Developers can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the Sprint Goal and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.
		"• Daily Scrums improve #communications#, identify #impediments#, and promote #quick decision-making#, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings
		#Developers# often meet #during the day# for more #detailed discussions# to further #adapt# or #re-plan# the Sprint
			"The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprint’s work.
	#Sprint Review# - at the #end# of the Sprint, the Team meets with #key stakeholders# to #looks forward# by inspecting the #Increments# and collaborating on #next steps#
		To #inspect# the Sprint with a view to future #adaptation#, the team presents the #outcome of the Sprint# to #key stakeholders# and discusses #progress# towards the #Product Goal#
			"The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
		The #Sprint Review# is a #working session# to #review accomplishments# and any #environmental changes#, #collaborate# on #next steps#, and #adjust# the #Product Backlog#
			"During the event, the Scrum Team and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the Scrum Team should avoid limiting it to a presentation.
		This takes a #maximum of four hours#, but can often be shorter
			"The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
	#Sprint Retrospective# - to #conclude# the Sprint, the Team meets #privately# to #look back# at the completed Sprint, and plan ways to increase #quality# and #effectiveness#
		"The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.
		"The Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done.
			"Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The Scrum Team discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.
		"The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness.
			"The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.
		This takes a #maximum of four hours#, but can often be shorter
			"The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is timeboxed to a maximum of #three hours# for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
	
"#Scrum Artifacts#" - the team's #measurable output# is~a #product backlog#, a #sprint backlog#, and some #increments#
	
	"Scrum’s artifacts represent #work or value#
		"They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.
	"Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured
		"• For the Product Backlog it is the Product Goal.
		• For the Sprint Backlog it is the Sprint Goal.
		• For the Increment it is the Definition of Done.
		"These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the Scrum Team and their stakeholders.
	
	"#Product Backlog# - The Product Backlog is an #emergent, ordered list# of what is needed to #improve the product#
		"It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
		"Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparency after refining activities. Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an ongoing activity to add details, such as a description, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.
		"The Developers who will be doing the work are responsible for the sizing. The Product Owner may influence the Developers by helping them understand and select trade-offs.
	"The Product Backlog's measurable #Commitment# is the #Product Goal#
		"The Product Goal describes a future state of the product which can serve as a target for the Scrum Team to plan against. The Product Goal is in the Product Backlog. The rest of the Product Backlog emerges to define “what” will fulfill the Product Goal.
		"#A product is a vehicle to deliver value.#
		#It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, well-defined users or customers.#
		#A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.#
		"The Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum Team. They must fulfill (or abandon) one objective before taking on the next.
	
	"#Sprint Backlog# - the Sprint Goal (#why#), the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (#what#), and an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (#how#)
		"The Sprint Backlog is a plan by and for the Developers. It is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Developers plan to accomplish during the Sprint in order to achieve the Sprint Goal. Consequently, the Sprint Backlog is updated throughout the Sprint as more is learned. It should have enough detail that they can inspect their progress in the Daily Scrum.
	"The Sprint Backlog's measurable #Commitment# is the #Sprint Goal#
		"The Sprint Goal is the single objective for the Sprint. Although the Sprint Goal is a commitment by the Developers, it provides flexibility in terms of the exact work needed to achieve it. The Sprint Goal also creates coherence and focus, encouraging the Scrum Team to work together rather than on separate initiatives.
		"The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. As the Developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint Goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.
	
	"#Increment# - An Increment is a #concrete stepping stone# toward the #Product Goal#
		"Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.
		"Multiple Increments may be created within a Sprint. The sum of the Increments is presented at the Sprint Review thus supporting empiricism. However, an Increment may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint. The Sprint Review should never be considered a gate to releasing value.
		"Work cannot be considered part of an Increment unless it meets the Definition of Done.
	"The Increment's measurable #Commitment# is the #Definition of Done#
		"The Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.
		"The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.
		"The Definition of Done creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the Increment. If a Product Backlog item does not meet the Definition of Done, it cannot be released or even presented at the Sprint Review. Instead, it returns to the Product Backlog for future consideration.
		"If the Definition of Done for an increment is part of the standards of the organization, all Scrum Teams must follow it as a minimum. If it is not an organizational standard, the Scrum Team must create a Definition of Done appropriate for the product.
		"The Developers are required to conform to the Definition of Done. If there are multiple Scrum Teams working together on a product, they must mutually define and comply with the same Definition of Done.
